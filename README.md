# JGEA

Java General Evolutionary Algorithm (jgea) is a modular Java framework for experimenting with [Evolutionary Computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_computation).

JGEA aims at providing a general interface to potentially *all* evolutionary algorithms (EA).
To do so, it provides an interface to problems that can be solved with an EA and components of an EA.
